The CL-postgres module implements a rather low-level interface for
communicating with a PostgreSQL database server. It is part of the Postmodern
library, but can be used separately.

* Connecting
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       6c37a5bc-e314-4936-bad8-b39c9bb3e4fa
  :END:
** class database-connection
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       5cded584-56ec-4c2d-bab9-df081b61e121
   :END:

Representation of a database connection. Contains login information in order to be able to automatically re-establish a connection when it is somehow closed.

** function open-database (database user password host &optional (port 5432) (use-ssl :no))
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       f4429361-bc8d-4c27-b3af-af70b676081c
   :END:
→ database-connection

Create and open a connection for the specified server, database, and user.
use-ssl may be :no, :try, :require, :yes, or :full
- :try means if the server supports it
- :require means use provided ssl certificate with no verification
- :yes means verify that the server cert is issued by a trusted CA, but does not verify the server hostname
- :full means expect a CA-signed cert for the supplied hostname and verify the server hostname

If you set it to anything other than :no be sure to also load the CL+SSL library.
When it is anything but :no, you must have the CL+SSL package loaded to initiate the connection.

On SBCL and Clozure CL, the value :unix may be passed for host, in order to
connect using a Unix domain socket instead of a TCP socket.

** function close-database (database-connection)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       44eb26db-1341-4427-8d96-7813b8014396
   :END:

Close a database connection. It is advisable to call this on connections when
you are done with them. Otherwise the open socket will stick around until it
is garbage collected, and no one will tell the database server that we are done
with it.

** function reopen-database (database-connection)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       dc658d2c-d67c-4cd9-a719-b8a402eecc1b
   :END:

Re-establish a database connection for a previously closed connection object.
(Calling this on a connection that is still open is harmless.)

** function database-open-p (database-connection)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       e2bab886-8144-4ccf-a12d-6958de97da93
   :END:
→ boolean

Returns a boolean indicating whether the given connection is currently connected.

** method connection-meta (database-connection)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       f258cf9d-cad3-44f7-b1d2-7da57c73f0cc
   :END:
→ hash-table

This method provides access to a hash table that is associated with the
current database connection, and is used to store information about the
prepared statements that have been parsed for this connection.

** method connection-parameters (database-connection)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       b5944a42-40cb-48a3-97a6-fdd79bc900ec
   :END:
→ hash-table

This method returns a mapping (string to string) containing all the
configuration parameters for the connection.

variable *unix-socket-dir*

Directory where the Unix domain socket for PostgreSQL be found.

On SBCL, when using the :unix keyword as host argument when creating a
connection, this variable determines the directory in which CL-Postgres
will look for the socket file.

variable *ssl-certificate-file*
variable *ssl-key-file*

When using SSL (see open-database), these can be used to provide client key
and certificate files. They can be either NIL, for no file, or a pathname.

variable *retry-connect-times* (5)

How many times do we try to connect again. Borrowed from pgloader

variable *retry-connect-delay* (0.5)

How many seconds to wait before trying to connect again. Borrowed from pgloader

** function wait-for-notification (database-connection)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       106b659f-a234-48cd-86e3-9c0e3951ba66
   :END:

This function blocks until asynchronous notification is received on the connection. Retrun the channel string, the payload and notifying pid as multiple values. The PostgreSQL LISTEN command must be used to enable listening for notifications.

** function get-postgresql-version (database-connection)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       b3ad3928-7603-4df8-97b4-c112e362f59c
   :END:
This function returns the version of the connected postgresql instance as a string.

** function postgresql-version-at-least (desired-version connection)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       e0b78f36-4ed2-4c58-9ed5-81f92ad30f3c
   :END:

Takes a postgresql version number which should be a string with the major and minor versions separated by a period e.g. '12.2' or '9.6.17'. Checks against the connection understanding of the running postgresql version and returns t if the running version is the requested version or newer.
* Querying
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       2ad7cf5b-68c5-4a9e-85a4-af5ab329551c
  :END:
** function exec-query (database-connection query &optional (row-reader 'ignore-row-reader))
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       3b4897a3-73ce-4c70-b74b-1880bc62cecd
   :END:
→ result

Sends the given query to the given connection, and interprets the results (if
there are any) with the given row-reader. If the database returns information
about the amount of rows affected, this is returned as a second value.

** function prepare-query (database-connection name query)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       76b91fb3-750b-4d61-97d6-a99c66edcb55
   :END:

Parse and plan the given query, and store it under the given name. Note that
prepared statements are per-connection, so they can only be executed through
the same connection that prepared them.

** function exec-prepared (database-connection name parameters &optional (row-reader 'ignore-row-reader))
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       1381ab1c-f89f-4f12-9cf2-997ebfc1b97d
   :END:
→ result

Execute the prepared statement by the given name. Parameters should be given
as a list. Each value in this list should be of a type that to-sql-string has
been specialised on. (Byte arrays will be passed in their binary form,
without being put through to-sql-string.) The result of the executing the
statement, if any, is interpreted by the given row reader, and returned.
Again, the number or affected rows is optionally returned as a second value.

** function unprepare-query (database-connection name)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       9f32c4e8-58a2-436c-8220-87eab74098bb
   :END:

Close the prepared query given by name by closing the session connection.
Does not remove the query from the meta slot in connection.

** method to-sql-string (value)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       44bfb336-e1db-41f2-b279-cf6d418d9aa3
   :END:
→ (values string needs-escaping)

Convert a Lisp value to its textual unescaped SQL representation. Returns a
second value indicating whether this value should be escaped if it is to be
put directly into a query. Generally any string is going to be designated to be escaped.

You can define to-sql-string methods for your own datatypes if you want to be
able to pass them to exec-prepared. When a non-NIL second value is returned,
this may be T to indicate that the first value should simply be escaped as a
string, or a second string providing a type prefix for the value. (This is
used by S-SQL.)
** variable *silently-truncate-ratios*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       93d593c6-70f2-4c62-aadd-5dc48c72cb48
   :END:

Given a ratio, a stream and a digital-length-limit, if *silently-truncate-ratios* is true,
will return a potentially truncated ratio. If false and the digital-length-limit is reached,
it will throw an error noting the loss of precision and offering to continue or reset
*silently-truncate-ratios* to true. Code contributed by Attila Lendvai.

** variable *silently-truncate-rationals*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       5ab0cb88-e5aa-446b-8160-8dc3cf53dd34
   :END:

When a rational number is passed into a query (as per to-sql-string), but it
can not be expressed within 38 decimal digits (for example 1/3), it will be
truncated, and lose some precision. Set this variable to nil to suppress
that behaviour and raise an error instead.

** variable *query-log*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       1767cf7a-a8f0-43aa-ad95-6c6294965efd
   :END:

When debugging, it can be helpful to inspect the queries that are being sent
to the database. Set this variable to an output stream value (*standard-output*,
for example) to have CL-postgres log every query it makes.

** variable *query-callback*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       8007d8c8-a315-4f5e-8398-9ec768fcc201
   :END:

When profiling or debugging, the *query-log* may not give enough information,
or reparsing its output may not be feasible. This variable may be set to a
designator of function taking two arguments. This function will be then called
after every query, and receive query string and internal time units (as in
(CL:GET-INTERNAL-REAL-TIME)) spent in query as its arguments.

Default value of this variable is 'LOG-QUERY, which takes care of *QUERY-LOG*
processing. If you provide custom query callback and wish to keep *QUERY-LOG*
functionality, you will have to call LOG-QUERY from your callback function

** function log-query (query internal-time)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       9ad4c0a7-90cb-4190-b8f9-a875220b4807
   :END:

This function is default value of *QUERY-CALLBACK* and logs queries
to *QUERY-LOG* if it is not NIL.

* Reading values
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       3d22ee03-bb03-4833-9b12-0bd18eec1495
  :END:
CL-postgres knows how to convert commonly used PostgreSQL data types to Lisp
values. This table shows the mapping:

| PostgreSQL	     | Lisp                       |
| smallint	       | integer                    |
| integer          | 	integer                  |
| bigint	         | integer                    |
| numeric	        | ratio                      |
| real	           | float                      |
| double precision | 	double-float             |
| boolean	        | boolean                    |
| varchar          | 	string                   |
| text	           | string                     |
| bytea	          | (vector (unsigned-byte 8)) |
| array            | array                      |
The mapping from PostgreSQL types (identified by OID numbers) to the functions
that interpret them is kept in so-called SQL readtables. All types for which
no reader is defined will be returned as string values containing their
PostgreSQL representation.

variable *sql-readtable*

The exported special var holding the current read table, a hash
mapping OIDs to instances of the type-interpreter class that contain
functions for retreiving values from the database in text, and
possible binary, form.

For simple use, you will not have to touch this, but it is possible that code within a Lisp image
requires different readers in different situations, in which case you can create separate read tables.

** function copy-sql-readtable (table)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       9a167cf2-b370-4f94-948d-5b18d53807a2
   :END:
→ readtable

Copies a given readtable.

** function default-sql-readtable ()
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       0cfa9da6-3c72-4e81-99c4-22cc51faaee8
   :END:
→ readtable

Returns the default readtable, containing only the readers defined by
CL-postgres itself.

** function set-sql-reader (oid function &key table binary-p)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       6809275d-a961-4bcb-919b-8d39048483ca
   :END:

Define a new reader for a given type. table defaults to *sql-readtable*.
The reader function should take a single argument, a string, and transform
that into some kind of equivalent Lisp value. When binary-p is true, the reader
function is supposed to directly read the binary representation of the value.
In most cases this is not recommended, but if you want to use it: provide a
function that takes a binary input stream and an integer (the size of the
value, in bytes), and reads the value from that stream. Note that reading
less or more bytes than the given size will horribly break your connection.

** function set-sql-datetime-readers (&key date timestamp timestamp-with-timezone time interval table)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       8d8da14e-8b04-42b0-ae42-c5a934441469
   :END:

Since there is no widely recognised standard way of representing dates and
times in Common Lisp, and reading these from string representation is clunky
and slow, this function provides a way to easily plug in binary readers for
the date, time, timestamp, and interval types. It should be given functions
with the following signatures:

- :date (days)

Where days is the amount of days since January 1st, 2000.

- :timestamp (useconds)

Timestamps have a microsecond resolution. Again, the zero point is the start
of the year 2000, UTC.

- :timestamp-with-timezone

Like :timestamp, but for values of the 'timestamp with time zone' type (which
PostgreSQL internally stores exactly the same as regular timestamps).

- :time (useconds)

Refers to a time of day, counting from midnight.

- :interval (months days useconds)

An interval is represented as several separate components. The reason that days
and microseconds are separated is that you might want to take leap seconds into
account.

* Row readers
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       336b75f9-544a-4e9a-8cd8-bd3353e072ed
  :END:
Row readers are a way to read and group the results of queries. Roughly, they
are functions that perform the iteration over the rows and cells in the
result, and do something with the returned values.

** macro row-reader ((fields) &body body)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       e9a4790e-3e16-4b79-872b-a0a861c38cba
   :END:
→ function

Creates a row-reader, using the given name for the variable. Inside the body
this variable refers to a vector of field descriptions. On top of that, two
local functions are bound, next-row and next-field. The first will start
reading the next row in the result, and returns a boolean indicating whether
there is another row. The second will read and return one field, and should
be passed the corresponding field description from the fields argument as a
parameter.

A row reader should take care to iterate over all the rows in a result, and
within each row iterate over all the fields. This means it should contain
an outer loop that calls next-row, and every time next-row returns T it
should iterate over the fields vector and call next-field for every field.

The definition of list-row-reader should give you an idea what a row reader
looks like:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(row-reader (fields)
  (loop :while (next-row)
        :collect (loop :for field :across fields
                       :collect (next-field field))))
#+END_SRC

Obviously, row readers should not do things with the database connection
like, say, close it or start a new query, since it still reading out the
results from the current query.

** macro def-row-reader (name (fields) &body body)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       10ee99db-865e-4880-86a2-a53d0a189175
   :END:

The defun-like variant of row-reader: creates a row reader and gives it a
top-level function name.

** method field-name (field)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       b4f2749d-a489-4c58-8635-83c6ca1ddd59
   :END:
→ string

This can be used to get information about the fields read by a row reader.
Given a field description, it returns the name the database associated with
this column.

** method field-type (field)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       5035128a-a2a8-4637-bb9c-1228317da3b3
   :END:
→ oid

This extracts the PostgreSQL OID associated with this column. You can, if
you really want to, query the pg_types table to find out more about the
types denoted by OIDs.

** function list-row-reader (socket fields)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       3dca00ab-3983-486a-83be-211f08eeadd0
   :END:
→ list

A row reader that builds a list of lists from the query results.

** function alist-row-reader (socket fields)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       5d623581-75bf-48ae-92a8-a8f63d59969b
   :END:
→ alist

A row reader that returns a list of alists, which associate column names with
values.

** function ignore-row-reader (socket fields)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       ce755aa5-bb6d-4642-94db-699bb3431c6b
   :END:

A row reader that completely ignores the result of a query.

* Bulk Copying
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       e8988375-c6c1-41dd-a8ed-a05f1cfc2e88
  :END:
When loading large amounts of data into PostgreSQL, it can be done
significantly faster using the bulk copying feature. The drawback to this
approach is that you don't find out about data integrity errors until the
entire batch is completed but sometimes the speed is worth it

** function open-db-writer (db table &optional columns)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       201aea77-e3f4-4575-9651-bd712d97b57c
   :END:

Opens a table stream into which rows can be written one at a time using
db-write-row. db is either a connection object or a list of arguments that
could be passed to open-database. table is the name of an existing table
into which this writer will write rows. If you don't have data for all
columns, use columns to indicate those that you do.

** function close-db-writer (writer &key abort)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       33f41251-d294-468b-97ba-480bbdbb0f73
   :END:

Closes a bulk writer opened by open-db-writer. Will close the associated
database connection when it was created for this copier, or abort is true.

** function db-write-row (writer row-data)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       70082c1c-dd42-41a4-8676-904f6241de7d
   :END:

Writes row-data into the table and columns referenced by the writer.
row-data is a list of Lisp objects, one for each column included when
opening the writer. Arrays (the elements of which must all be the same type)
will be serialized into their PostgreSQL representation before being written
into the DB.
* Normalization
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       3eb961af-8ada-4bf4-8027-c158638891f6
  :END:
** function saslprep-normalize (str &optional form)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       7be15b9c-09e8-4a3d-be4c-410108b73681
   :END:
→ string

Scans string. If any character should be mapped to nothing, it eliminates that character. If any character is not printable ascii, it returns nil. If every character remaining after eliminations is printable ascii, it returns the printable-ascii string. It then calls (uax-15:normalize str form) to normalize the string based on the provided unicode form, defaulting to :nfkc.

** function string-mapped-to-nothing (str)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       6bf426e0-4915-4e4b-9f9b-5c0f614770cf
   :END:
→ string

Reads a string and removes any character that should be mapped to nothing per RFC 3454 and RFC 4013.

** function string-mapped-to-space (str)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       105584f2-2224-41f1-9ac4-b9c3b6f032a1
   :END:
→ string

Reads a string and converts any character which should be mapped to a space pre RFC 3454 and RFC 4013 to a space.

** function string-printable-ascii-p (str)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       bb3be8b3-bda0-4dc5-9eef-ec60f4cc41ed
   :END:
→ boolean

Returns t if every character in the string is printable ascii.
* Conditions
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       2ea005bf-7350-4a1c-b6e7-19da76acd2e6
  :END:
Opening or querying a database may raise errors. CL-postgres will wrap the
errors that the server returns in a lisp condition, and raise conditions of
the same type when it detects some problem itself. Socket errors are let
through as they are.

** condition database-error
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       212caa5b-cc60-41a4-b26a-1bc70df5f0e3
   :END:

This is the condition type that will be used to signal virtually all database-related errors \(though in some cases
socket errors may be raised when a connection fails on the IP level). For errors that you may want to catch by type, the cl-postgres-error package defines a bucket of subtypes used for specific errors. See the cl-postgres/package.lisp file for a list.

** method database-error-message (database-error)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       7962524a-455d-4f68-bf21-35476b8bf929
   :END:
→ string

The primary human-readable error message. This should be accurate but terse (typically one line). Always present.

** method database-error-detail (database-error)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       11d194c1-c32f-436e-bfc6-1390b2391f1c
   :END:
→ string

Detail: an optional secondary error message carrying more detail about the problem. Might run to multiple lines or NIL if none is available.

** method database-error-code (database-error)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       aefb04d7-4f25-4be3-82fb-d21a7e123410
   :END:
→ string

Code: the Postgresql SQLSTATE code for the error (see the Postgresql Manual Appendix A for their meaning). Not localizable. Always present.

** method database-error-query (database-error)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       923da3dd-da4c-4f58-a1d1-3bc77481b8b4
   :END:
→ string

The query that led to this error, or NIL if no query was involved.

** method database-error-cause (database-error)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       9b07e8c0-355f-45d7-bc4f-dcf3e2f1217d
   :END:
→ condition

The condition that caused this error, or NIL when it was not caused by another condition.

** function database-error-constraint-name (database-error)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       d8d43625-e6b7-45e3-800c-6252a37f4d8e
   :END:
→ string

For integrity-violation error, given a database-error for an integrity violation, will attempt to
extract and return the constraint name (or nil if no constraint was found).

** function database-error-extract-name (database-error)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       7a009b31-b4ec-476a-a191-4ef59e7d6427
   :END:
→ string

For various errors, returns the name provided by the error message
 (or nil if no such name was found.)

** condition database-connection-error
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       1d9adc13-de7f-4b74-b1ce-5bff4e8faf2a
   :END:

Subtype of database-error. An error of this type (or one of its subclasses)
is signaled when a query is attempted with a connection object that is no
longer connected, or a database connection becomes invalid during a query.
Always provides a :reconnect restart, which will cause the library to make an
attempt to restore the connection and re-try the query.

The following shows an example use of this feature, a way to ensure that the
first connection error causes a reconnect attempt, while others pass through
as normal. A variation on this theme could continue trying to reconnect, with
successively longer pauses.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
